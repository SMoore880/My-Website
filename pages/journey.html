        <p>My good friend Sam started reading the Mistborn stories around 2016. I had just finished high school and
          wasn’t very interested in books at the time—school had burnt me out, haha. But he told me the books were on
          Audible, which sounded much easier to handle, so I decided to give it a listen.</p>
        <p>The experience began with a dark narrative that vividly described the brutal reality of slavery and the
          dehumanization of the skaa by the oppressive noblemen. I was both horrified and utterly intrigued by the raw,
          visceral detail of a world steeped in cruelty.</p>
        <p>From that moment on, I became a devoted fan. The original Mistborn trilogy not only introduced me to a
          universe of morally ambiguous characters and broken souls, but it also revealed a glimmer of hope and
          introduced concepts of redemption that profoundly shifted my perspective.</p>

        <h2 class="centered-header">My Timeline of the Cosmere</h2>
        <p>I began my journey with the original Mistborn Trilogy. From the very first pages, I was drawn into Scadrial—a
          world where decay and stagnation reign.</p>
        <p>Next, I read <em>Arcanum Unbound</em>, a collection of short stories that introduces several of the Cosmere
          worlds without revealing too many spoilers.</p>
        <p>After that, I dove into <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, a series where the world feels strikingly alien
          compared to our own.</p>
